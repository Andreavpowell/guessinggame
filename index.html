        <h1>Here's a little about myself:</h1>
        <p>My name is Dario and I am from berkeley california. I was born here and went to berkeley schools growing up. During the summer I would visit family memebers in cuba and oregon. I love traveling and competing in sports. One of my favorite sports to play is baseball but other than that I like watching eSports such as Valorant. I've worked as a terminal technician at the golden gate fields horse race track, as a safeway gorcery store employee, and as a lumberyard inventory stocker. I hope to further my knowledge of coding and become a software developer in the upcoming years.</p>
